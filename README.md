# About

  Neural Nets from Scratch is a project intended to build neural networks from the bottom up.
  The goal of this project is to learn how to implement basic neural network layers to gain 
  further understaning on how they work. This project also is intended for those who are curious
  about how libraries such as Tensorflow, or Pytorch work under the hood. 

## Built With
    
  The only library used in this project is numpy. 

# Getting Started
  
  The first thing you'll need to do is clone this repo, and change into into the neural-nets-from-scratch directory

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/knarfamlap/neural_nets_from_scratch.git
  $ cd neural_nets_from_scratch
  ```

  Once you're inside the directory, I recommended using a virtual enviroment. More on virtual enviroments [here]()
  Once you grabbed a virtual env, you can install the dependencies with the following command

  ```bash
  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
